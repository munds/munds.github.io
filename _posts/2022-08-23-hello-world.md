Hello, 世界!

This page is rendered via GitHub pages. Problem with being an endless tinkerer is that nothing gets done, and we have to change that.

The principle of KISS is something I aspire to, in the spirit of that (and wanting a website with minimal cost/maintenance), I decided that [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will do the job perfectly.

Next step is to migrate https://munds.github.io to https://amol.one (and install `Let's Encrypt` along the way if needed)
