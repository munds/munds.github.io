Hi! I'm Amol and I am an endless tinkerer. Like many of us, I have a lot of projects
that are never complete. The first project was to have a website. So here we are!


Once I have a website, the plan is to build small things with literally everything
imaginable - just to get a feel for them. React, TypeScript, Frontent, Backend...
the possibilities are endless! And then anything I learn can be shared here. Just a
way of giving back from the endless knowledge I've gained from countless others.


Now the big question is, how much shall I end up doing, learning, sharing? Only one
way to find out! I have no idea how you come here, but my hearty welcome to all!
